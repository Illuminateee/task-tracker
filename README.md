go build -o task-tracker.exe cmd/main.go
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### Add a New Task
```bash
# Add task with title only
./task-tracker add "Buy groceries"

# Add task with title and description
./task-tracker add "Buy groceries" "Milk, bread, eggs, cheese"
```

#### List Tasks

## Task Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `todo` | Task is created but not started |
| `in-progress` | Task is currently being worked on |
| `done` | Task is completed |

## Data Storage

Tasks are stored in a JSON file called `tasks.json` in the current working directory. You can customize the storage location by setting the `TASK_TRACKER_DATA` environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export TASK_TRACKER_DATA="/path/to/your/tasks.json"

# Windows
set TASK_TRACKER_DATA="C:\path\to\your\tasks.json"
```

### Sample JSON Structure
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Buy groceries",
    "description": "Milk, bread, eggs, cheese",
    "status": "done",
    "created_at": "2025-10-06T10:30:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-06T15:45:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Write project documentation",
    "description": "Create comprehensive README and API docs",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "created_at": "2025-10-06T11:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-06T14:20:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Examples

### Complete Workflow Example
```bash
# Add some tasks
./task-tracker add "Complete project proposal" "Draft, review, and submit"
./task-tracker add "Schedule team meeting" "Next week availability check"
./task-tracker add "Code review" "Review PR #123"

# Check all tasks
./task-tracker list

# Start working on a task
./task-tracker mark-in-progress 1

# Complete a task
./task-tracker mark-done 3

# Check pending work
./task-tracker list pending

# Update task details
./task-tracker update 2 "Schedule team meeting" "Check availability for next Tuesday"

./task-tracker list done

# See current work in progress
./task-tracker list in-progress

# View all tasks for overview
./task-tracker list all
```

## Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles:

```
cmd/
  main.go                    # Application entry point
delivery/
  controller/
    cli_controller.go        # CLI interface and command handling
entity/
  task.go                    # Task entity and business rules
manager/
  task_manager.go            # Application coordinator
repository/
  task_repository.go         # Repository interface
  json_task_repository.go    # JSON file implementation
usecase/
  task_usecase.go            # Business logic layer
```

## Error Handling

The application provides clear error messages for common scenarios:
- Invalid task IDs
- Missing required parameters
- File access issues
- Invalid status values
- Non-existent tasks
